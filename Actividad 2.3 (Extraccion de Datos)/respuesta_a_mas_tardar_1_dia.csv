Como veis me acabo de iniciar en el mundo del alquiler y trabajo con ésta página que me parece estupenda.  Soy muy detallista y me gusta que os sintáis como en casa, siempre os dejo alguna cosilla para cuando lleguéis cansados del viaje. 
A mi también me gusta viajar y encontrar una casa limpia y acogedora. Soy muy sociable y comunicativa, no tendréis problema en preguntarme sobre la zona o cualquier cosa que necesitéis.  Aún quisiera mejorar más,  acepto sugerencias.  Yo me dedico a cantar lírica,  la música es mi gran pasión y los libros. No puedo estar sin leer. Me apasiona la historia y recorrer sitios hermosos que tengan eso, mucha historia. Otra de mis debilidades son los animales, por eso acepto mascotas, porque para mí forman parte de una familia
Mi sueño es una autocaravana , algún día la conseguiré y me volveré nómada jj.
Espero que al llegar a mi casa estéis a gusto y no os falte de nada ( cosas de aseo, más ropa de cama y toallas y algún detalle que se me ocurra). Porque otra de las cosas que más me gustan es ver a los demás felices. Si yo puedo proporcionaros al menos bienestar, me sentiré bien.
Pues nada, a grandes rasgos, esta soy yo. Disfrutad de la estancia y del viaje. Viajar, aprender, tener curiosidad por las cosas o simplemente relajarse....eso es VIVIR.

- I am Andrea
- and I am Jose

We are a Basque-Colombian easygoing couple living and loving San Sebastian :)

- I grew up in this beautiful city, I am a ""Donostiarra"", which is how people from Donostia-San Sebastian are called. I run a startup of Artificial Intelligence applied to digital marketing optimization, I love walking around San Seabastian any random afternoon contemplating the trees, the ocean or the sunset, also love playing volleybol, eating and I'm an avid fan of cooking, decorating spaces and every now and then restoring an antique piece of furniture. I met Jose back in 2016.

- And I am a Colombian and Basque (by heart and choice) raised in Cali who moved to San Sebastian in 2012 to study my Bachelor's degree and couldn't resist to stay. I work in Food Technology Research an Innovation, love playing volleyball, eating what Andrea cooks and dancing salsa; I've had culinary training and experience in the past so I love cooking too ;)

We enjoy meeting new, diverse people, their culture, their lifestyle and hearing a couple stories with a glass of red wine, local sider, coffee or just water. Traveling is one of our passions; combining trips together and and each on their own we've visited: Colombia, Spain, Sweeden, Denmark, Finland, India, USA, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Thailand, Vietnam, Malasya, Cambodia, South Korea, Jamaica, England, France, Germany, Portugal, Italy, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Canada, China, Marrocco and Israel. 

We have some good recommendations and spots for travelers to enjoy San Sebastian, including a pintxo-route and restaurant selection (curated by top chefs).
